  <p class="description">
    In this reverse horror game, you play as an entity hunting humans in a lab to collect their flesh and grow stronger, hoping to escape containment.
    <br/><br/>
    The game was made in 48h by Quasar and I for the GMTKJam 2023. It's mostly a cool experiment on atmosphere because the gameplay is kinda broken due to lack of time, but I'm still happy with the experiment!
    <br/><br/>
    Quasar worked on the music and sound design, I did the pixel art, shaders, 3D modeling and coding, and we both worked on game design and level design.
