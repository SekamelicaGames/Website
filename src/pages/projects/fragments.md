  <p class="description">
      Fragments was a 3D platformer in first person, with bullet-hell phases for the boss.<br>
      Inside an oniric world echoing feels and memories of someone, we try to understand why this world is close to destruction by finding various fragments (memories) to search if this world can be saved.<br/>
      With powers modyfing gravity and the flow of time, you can float in air and avoid hazards to explore theses giants ominous places.
